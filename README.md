## Alternative?

Essentially, instead of a classic Cards Against Humanity Game, you are each presented with a random sentence each, and may choose the provided completions or write your own.

Once you are all ready, you read them aloud for a fun effect.

There may be a vote then gamemaster may then write down the most voted sentence and keep track of scores.

The vote and score keeping are inteltionally kept "manual" in order to push the social aspect of the game, while enabiling it to be optional and allowing people to invent new ways to play.


## How to run

Any LAMP stack, you may even use some all-in-one LAMP server android app after storing the code somwhere in the device (example: [<img src="https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZclmmjV9UVPtq6ScS-98xovyAb1TF09QO5qjddF8LQaiEwfz7fDmR-7ZCdHAnDHoQ8o=s180" width="30">AWebServer ( Http Web Server Apache PHP Sql )](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sylkat.apache&hl=it&gl=US) )
